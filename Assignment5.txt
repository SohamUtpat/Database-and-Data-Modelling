Q1.Given the table: 1.orders _id, user_id, status, created_at 
   2.Suggest appropriate indexes 
   3.Explain why you chose them



2.Suggest appropriate indexes ----

 I think there are four appropriate indexes for the above columns names 

 a. Primary index on -- orders_id
 b. Index on -- user_id
 c. Composite Index on --- (user_id, created_at)
 d. composite Index on --- (status, created_at)


3.Explaination of choosing them ----

 a. Primary index on -- orders_id -----
    
       Every order must be uniquely identifiable.

       Ensures fast retrieval when searching by order ID.

       Helps maintain data integrity by preventing duplicates.

  b. Index on -- user_id -----
 
       Orders are frequently fetched based on the user.

       Improves performance when retrieving all orders placed by a specific user.

       Optimizes joins between the orders table and the users table.
   
  a. Composite index on -- (user_id, created_at) -----
 
       Useful when viewing a user’s order history in chronological order.

       Supports both filtering by user and sorting by order creation time.

       Reduces the need for additional sorting operations.

  a. Composite index on -- (Status, created_at) -----
 
       Helps in filtering orders based on their status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

       Efficient for reporting, analytics, and dashboard queries.

       Optimizes time-based queries on order statuses.
