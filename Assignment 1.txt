Q1.Identify at least 3 real-world applications and specify:
                                                            * Which type of database they use (SQL / NoSQL / In-memory)
                                                            * Why that database is suitable



* Three real world applications as follow

1.Instagram
2.Amazon
3.Uber

* Type of the Database they use as follow

1.Instagram --

* Type of Database --

  SQL: User accounts, relationships, metadata
  NoSQL: Posts, likes, comments, feeds (huge scale, flexible data)
  In-memory: Caching feeds, sessions, and fast lookups (e.g., Redis)

  So, basically it uses All types of Database.

* why that Database is suitable --

  Instagram handles billions of users, posts, likes, and comments every day.

  SQL databases -- are used for structured data such as user accounts and relationships because they ensure data consistency.
  NoSQL databases -- are suitable for storing posts, comments, and feeds as they can scale easily with massive data growth.
  In-memory databases -- are used for caching feeds and sessions to provide fast loading and real-time user experience.

2.Amazon --
  
* Type of Database --

  SQL: Orders, payments, transactions
  NoSQL: Product catalogs, recommendations (e.g., DynamoDB)
  In-memory: Shopping carts, session data, fast pricing lookups

  Amazon, also uses all types of Database.

* why that Database is suitable --

  Amazon manages millions of products and transactions simultaneously.

  SQL databases -- are used for orders, payments, and billing because they require high reliability and accuracy.
  NoSQL databases -- store product catalogs and recommendations since they handle large volumes of flexible data efficiently.
  In-memory databases -- are used for shopping carts and quick price lookups to reduce response time.

3.Uber -- 

* Type of Database --

  SQL: Billing, trip history, user data.
  NoSQL: Real-time location data, trip matching.
  In-memory: Live driver/rider matching, ETA calculations.

  Uber, also uses all types of Database.

* why that Database is suitable --

  Uber operates in real time and processes live location data.

  SQL databases -- store user profiles, trip history, and payment records.
  NoSQL databases -- are suitable for managing real-time location data and ride requests due to their high scalability.
  In-memory databases -- enable fast driver-rider matching and real-time ETA calculations.
