Assignment 6

Q1.A query frequently runs:

  SELECT * FROM bookings

  WHERE doctor_id = ?

  AND appointment_date >= ?

  AND appointment_date <= ?;

  Propose a composite index
  Explain column order choice.


2. Propose a composite index ---

     A composite index on doctor_id and appointment_date, 
     with doctor_id first and appointment_date second.


3. Explanation of column order choice ---

     a. doctor_id is placed first because :
            
                         It is used with an equality condition (=).

                         Equality filters are most selective and should come first in a composite index.

                         This allows the database to quickly narrow down records for a specific doctor.

     b. appointment_date is placed second because : 

                         It is used with a range condition (>= and <=).

                         After filtering by doctor, the index efficiently scans only the required date range.

                         This avoids scanning unnecessary rows.
